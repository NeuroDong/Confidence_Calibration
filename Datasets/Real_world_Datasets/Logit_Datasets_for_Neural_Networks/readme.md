# Logits

- The logits are outputs of a neural network model, before using softmax function.
- The logits are serialized using Python pickle function, example script is [here](https://github.com/markus93/NN_calibration/blob/master/scripts/utility/unpickle_probs.py).
- The abbreviated names of models and datasets are followed by the number of convolutional layers in them.
